                                October started differently, with something I'd been waiting for since I arrived in Brazil: a break. Between modules, PUC-SP gives a kind of mini-vacation. They're not "real" vacations, more like a week of rest to breathe, reorganize and prepare for what's coming. This October I got ten days like that, and they were perfect because my mom decided to visit me right during that time.

                                One of the most impactful experiences was visiting Solomon's Temple. It's a tour organized by an evangelical church that recreates various biblical scenarios: from the tabernacle to details nobody would expect to find in Brazil. They even bring real olive trees; there was one that was 400 years old. I stood there in silence just looking. It was impressive.

                                <p>Seeing a 400-year-old olive tree in person is something you can't explain properly. It's living history right in front of you.</p>

                                That same week, Design Week was also starting at the university. Since I was with my mom, I didn't go to all the activities, but I really took advantage of the workshop I attended. It was about graffiti, but explained from the authenticity of urban art.
                            </p>

                            <div class="learning-card">

                                    <li>If you paint on a wall with permission, it's muralism</li>
                                    <li>If you do it without permission, with adrenaline and risk, that's graffiti</li>
                                    <li>That simple difference completely changed my view of urban art</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                            <p>
                                They showed us different styles, how the lines move, the structure, the logic behind each stroke. Then we did a mini workshop and I had my first real approach to practice. It fascinated me. I've always liked urban art, but that day I felt it more alive than ever.

                                Between workshop and workshop, my mom kept having her sudden ideas, and one of them ended up being one of the best adventures of the month. One day she simply said: "What if we go to the aquarium?"
                                Half an hour later we already had tickets, packed bags and were getting on the bus. The trip lasted an hour and a half; it was super far. But it was worth every minute.

                                The aquarium was gigantic and had everything: axolotls, sharks, otters, manatees, seals, seahorses, and a bunch of species divided by world regions. The otters were my favorite part; they were adorable and super active. We also saw meerkats, lemurs, fruit-eating flying foxes and, in the Australia section, kangaroos.

                                And that's what I did. I started going out more with my friends. One day we cooked Bolivian arepas at one of their houses. We made them with corn flour, milk, cheese, butter, a touch of salt and sugar. We let it rest and then cooked it in the pan. They turned out incredibly well.

                                We were so proud that we took pictures of the dough, the process and the result. Then we had an improvised karaoke and the next day we visited a SESC, which is like a huge cultural center. It had everything: library, pools, cafeteria, gym, workshops, art exhibitions.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In one of the areas, we saw a lady telling stories to children. Half jokingly I said: "What if we ask her to read to us too?"
                                We ended up there for an hour, listening to children's stories. Another lady was playing ukulele, which added extra charm to the scene.

She said she had traveled there several times and was in love with the country, especially with cuñapé, sonso and arepa. I told her that was exactly what we'd had for breakfast that day and it was a nice little moment I won't forget.</p>

                                And yes, before I forget: there was also room for my fictional obsessions. This month the news came out about Bakugo's copper statue. After his most intense arc in the manga and his epic "resurrection", seeing him recognized like this — within his own world and outside of it — moved me so much.

                                Overall, October was one of my best months. Between my mom, the workshops, the outings, the aquarium, my friends, the cultural centers and the unexpected moments, I felt like I lived a very complete and happy version of myself.

                                October taught me that the best memories come from spontaneous moments. From sudden decisions to go to the aquarium, from workshops you attend out of curiosity, from children's stories you listen to as a joke, and from arepas you make with friends on any random Sunday.
