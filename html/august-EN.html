                                On August 1st I came back from Bolivia. I had spent delightful vacation and, honestly, I felt more homesick for Santa Cruz than I imagined. It was nice to return, although I also came back with a kind of renewed affection for São Paulo. Not necessarily for the city itself, but for the desire to make the most of the last months I had left in Brazil.

                                    <p>I arrived at my apartment happy, with a clarity I hadn't felt in a long time. I knew what I had to do and what my goal was. 💜</p>

                                A few days later, a new module started: Usability, UX/UI. It lasted two months and, although I was excited, I had a hidden nervousness that I didn't tell anyone. I had to get to know a completely new course, classmates I hadn't seen before, different dynamics... and that always feels a bit overwhelming.
                            </p>

                                <p>I chose UX/UI because, although they had taught me well in Bolivia, I myself knew there were parts I didn't master.</p>

                                In my previous group, I did the HTML and my friend did the CSS, so I never finished learning properly. And that worried me, because deep down I knew that without that foundation everything else falls apart. I also knew how to use Figma, but I had forgotten components, flows, details. One day I reviewed my old account and found first-year work that now embarrasses me a bit, although I understand perfectly why they were like that.

                                A few weeks before classes started, I went out with my roomie to Liberdade, a Japanese neighborhood here in São Paulo, considered one of the largest in Latin America. We ate delicious ramen, the kind that looks like it came straight out of Naruto, and it made me so happy.

                                When classes finally started, something curious happened. In mid-month—I think it was August 14th—Stray Kids, my favorite K-pop group, released an album: Karma. I was in another world. I loved the songs, especially "0801". It touched me deeply; I cried several times listening to it.

                                A few days later, walking through a mall, I found an exhibition of Arab-inspired rings. Beautiful. I spent a good while looking at them. This month I also visited church a lot because a friend invited me, and I ended up connecting with nature in an unexpected way.

                                At the end of August we did an improvised photo session with a friend. It was also election time, so I had to go vote with my roomie. At the university I found several cats, including one that looked half rabbit (I couldn't take a picture, but it exists, I swear).

                                This month I also rewatched True Beauty, a k-drama. Let's just say my patience with the protagonist reached its limit and I ended up getting more attached to a secondary character who doesn't even end up with the girl. This emotional re-reading led me to create a photopoem: a mix between poem and images, something I learned from a teacher in Bolivia and that I love.

                                Already into the UX/UI module, the first activity was to invent a futuristic "DeLorean-style" application. I made something with a kind of retro-radioactive aesthetic and the teachers really liked it. The pixelated images I made almost pixel by pixel because I couldn't find references, but it was worth it.

                                I also tried a virtual reality headset in another class and it was super fun. In another subject I did a Spotify analysis and was quite satisfied with the result.

                                In August we also celebrated a birthday and everyone could ask for whatever they wanted. I asked for a Whopper Rodeo, a perfect combination of my two favorite burgers—in Bolivia I always dreamed of that mix—and here in Brazil it exists. It was obvious I would like it, but I was still surprised by how much I enjoyed it.

                                After that, one of the moments that marked me most was having gone out alone on Avenida Paulista. I walked a lot until I reached Casa das Rosas. There were no roses at that time, but I still liked being there. I bought a book about the art of maturing, which I started but haven't finished yet. Still, I'm enjoying it quite a bit.

                                And that's how August ended. The 31st was my day at Casa das Rosas, my new book under my arm, and the beautiful feeling of having lived a month full of small important things.
