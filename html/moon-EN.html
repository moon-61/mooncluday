                                <p>Moon Clouday was my last project in Brazil and, from the start, I already knew it was going to be totally different from everything I had done before. The idea came up almost by accident: a friend from my first class said to me: "Clau, why don't you make a blog about your experience here in Brazil?", and I thought: "ok, that could work". But what seemed simple quickly became absolute creative chaos. I made at least four different styles: one with 90s aesthetics, very indie and retro; another more normal, corporate, like a company; one in journal style, as if it were a notebook; and a standard one that seemed safe, but nothing convinced me. Every Monday, when I had to present progress, I felt absolute terror: "what am I going to show?", "how am I going to justify this?". It was tragic and, at the same time, hilarious. I laughed at my own desperation while dying inside. And, as always, my head wouldn't stop jumping: "what if they don't like it?", "what if I ruin everything?". Everything fell on me, and every mistake was completely mine. It was a moment when I understood that a personal project is a mirror of your anxiety, your perfectionism and your obsessions — and that you need to learn to deal with all of that to create something authentic.</p>

                                <p>When I showed my three initial versions, the comments from classmates and professors were a shock: "I like A", "B is good", "I prefer C"… but nobody explained why. That's when I remembered something I was always taught: saying "I like it" doesn't help; that's not feedback. What really matters is explaining why something works or not. The professors destroyed me, yes, but rightfully so: they pointed out what was good, what wasn't, and how I could improve. At first, I wanted to cry and throw everything out the window, but little by little I understood that this was the magic of the process: combining what was positive in each proposal and creating something coherent. Meanwhile, I was dealing with my Javascript programming tasks and the mix of emotions about my last month in Brazil: nostalgia, wanting to stay, wanting to return. To make it worse, I was sad because My Hero Academia, my favorite anime and a great inspiration for me, was already ending — emotions that confused me and made me feel alive at the same time. It was an intense learning of patience, self-knowledge and resilience.</p>

                                <p>
                                    I finally decided that Moon Clouday wouldn't be a regular blog. It would be a page about me, combining my projects, learnings, experiences and, above all, my personality. A place where other design students who feel lost can see the real process: mistakes, creative blocks, failed experiments and solutions found. I wanted to show that it's okay to make mistakes, that creativity needs patience and care, and that personal projects are neither linear nor perfect. Besides, I couldn't leave out my personal touch: from stickers to small details of my favorite things, including my absolute love for Bakugo. Yes, Bakugo. Because, if something inspires and motivates me, it's that explosive, stubborn and brilliant guy. Every time I worked on the page and thought about the creative details, I felt like a bit of his attitude pushed me not to give up and to make everything perfect, explosive and authentic — just the way I am.

                                <p>To bring Moon Clouday to life, I used Javascript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, incorporating animations, stickers and elements that reflect my personality and my love for the 90s. Every decision was thought out with great care: from the initial sketches to the final organization of the content, through the aesthetics, colors and interactivity. I didn't just want to show my projects, but also reflect how everyday life — the walks, the shows, walking alone or with friends, and even small obsessions like Bakugo — feed my creativity. Moon Clouday is the culmination of my experience in Brazil: a personal, technical and emotional project, combining design, narrative and fun. I'm proud of the result: I managed to transform pressure, anxiety and uncertainty into something tangible, beautiful and useful. This page is my way of saying: "I know it's difficult, but your creativity deserves care, space and fun — and yes, you can put a little explosion in everything you do".</p>
