                                September was one of those strange months where you feel like you did nothing... but at the same time did a ton. With the start of my project, I was practically buried in classes every day. Between one task and another I ended up learning so much: heuristics, good usability practices, accessibility, comfort, data security... that whole universe I'd always seen superficially, but now finally understood for real.
                            </p>

                                    <p>Finally everything started making sense! Heuristics weren't just pretty words anymore, they were real tools I could use. 💜</p>

                                One of the activities that made me laugh the most was a comparison between two similar apps. Most groups chose the typical: Mercado Livre vs. Amazon, Deezer vs. Spotify... those things everyone knows. But I knew everyone was going to do the same, so I proposed to my group to compare PedidosYa with iFood. And they said yes.
                            </p>

                            <div class="learning-card">

                                    <li>Nielsen's heuristics in practice (not just theory!)</li>
                                    <li>Good usability practices that make a real difference</li>
                                    <li>Accessibility isn't optional, it's essential</li>
                                    <li>Data security needs to be in every design decision</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                            <p>
                                It was a somewhat risky idea, but it turned out better than expected: ironically, PedidosYa ended up being much more intuitive and comfortable for users than iFood. I didn't expect that.

                                This month I also saw a movie that left my heart soft. It's called "Love Untangled", and what a wonderful story. It's not the classic superficial plot where the protagonist chooses the handsome guy just because. No. Here she really thinks, feels, recognizes who truly loves her, even though she realizes it late.
                            </p>

                                I cried more than once, especially in one scene: she asks for a "big" candy, and he shows up with something the size of a board. Says he brought the biggest one he could find. That tenderness completely disarmed me. What beautiful love.

                                <p>It's not about choosing the handsome guy. It's about recognizing who really loves you, even if it takes you a while to realize. This kind of story touches me in a different way.</p>

                                Mid-month, the music videos from Stray Kids' Karma album started coming out, which they'd released in August. What an impressive production. Everything impeccable. And Bang Chan, as always, shining as if he were born to be under a spotlight.

                                Some time before, a friend had invited me to a K-pop meetup. I went without expecting much, maybe just to make one new friend... and I ended up with two more. Brazilian people are incredibly kind and outgoing; the more I get to know them, the more they surprise me.

                                Between activities, I kept advancing on my project. And although I didn't go out as much as in other months, every time I did go out I made the most of it. But the truth is I was very focused on finishing, polishing details, organizing deliveries... that kind of thing that eats up hours without you noticing.

                                September 24th was special. That day celebrates the libertarian cry of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, it's the most important date for those from there. I felt immense nostalgia.

                                I saw my friends' stories at the serenade and wanted to be there. I missed my city so much, its people, its music, its energy. It's funny how you only realize how much you love a place when you're far from it.

                                Looking back, September was a month of deep immersion. Immersion in the project, in learning, in the details that make a difference in UX/UI. But it was also a month of small important pauses: the movie that made me cry, walks without headphones, new friendships, and of course, homesickness.
                            </p>

                            <div class="gratitude-box">

                                <div class="gratitude-list">
                                    <p>✨ For finally truly understanding everything I was learning</p>
                                    <p>✨ For the beautiful movie that made me believe in love again</p>
                                    <p>✨ For Stray Kids' impeccable music videos</p>
                                    <p>✨ For the new friends I made at the K-pop meetup</p>
                                    <p>✨ For walks without headphones that became therapy</p>
                                    <p>✨ For being able to feel homesick, because it means I have a place and people to love</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>
                                And so September ended: between work, discoveries, small outings, new friendships and a renewed affection for my homeland. A quieter month, but full of details that made it meaningful.

                                <p>September taught me that being focused doesn't mean isolating yourself. That homesickness isn't weakness, it's love. And that sometimes the "quieter" months are the ones that teach us the most about ourselves. 💚✨</p>
